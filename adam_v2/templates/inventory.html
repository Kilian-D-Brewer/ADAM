<h1>Inventory System</h1>

<p>
This is where the inventory system is placed. The goal is that a 
mobile app is used to scan QR Codes on the inventory items and 
the necessary information is added automatically. Will be integrated
with the Sales system so that it is always known:</p><br>
<li>
How much ingredients are in stock?</li><br>
<li>
How much product is in stock?</li><br>
