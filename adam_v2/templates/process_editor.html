<h1>Process Editor</h1>
I am currently working on this part of they project. The idea is as 
follows:

<ul>
<li>Let the user upload SVG files for the SCADA interface</li>
<li>Let the user upload text files describing the inteface variables 
in a pythonic way</li>
<li>The user then sees the uploaded SVG and can assign a text files to it</li>
<li>Now the user can drag the SVG into the process editor</li></ul>
{% endblock %}
